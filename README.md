# Bikesharing in NYC

## Overview

We are performing an analysis on Citibike Data in NYC. The purpose of this analysis is to explore by Data visualization, the opportunities of bikesharing in NYC to evaluate if it would be a hood business Model to implement in Des Moins.

## Results
The following results can be seen in a story from Tableau Public, where all the visualizations are present:

### Checkout Times
With the checkout times, we can evidence that the mayority of bikesaring lasts less than 20 minutes, this means that if a user arrives and there is no avilable bikes at the moment, the highest waiting time will be 20min which is not a high waiting time.

The Checkout time for women and men are following the same pattern, less than 20min. Although, in this visualization we can evidence that Men are the highest consumers of bikeshares.

### Trips 
The behaviour of trips, as we can evidence in this visualization. Has a clear pattern that the highest hours of usage are from 5 to 6pm and the top days to rent a bike are Monday, Tuesday, and the highest, Thursday.

The trips by weekday and gender, reflect that the pattern seen previously applies in Women and Men population, as the times and days are the same. 
We can also rectify that the mayority of population that uses citibike are men.

In this visualization, we are able to see a clear effect in behaviour of suscribed users vs non suscribed users.
With Suscribed users, we see a higher consumption of bikesharing vs. non suscriberd users (consumers).
The only gender for which this pattern is not followed is with the "unknown" population, so it is very important to identify this population.

### Location
We can see in this visualization the density of places where the bikesharing begins, also known as start location, where we see that Manhattan has some stratigic places where there have to be more bikes avalilable so that consumers can find available bikes.

We can evidence in this map the end locations, it is important that logistically the bikes delivered at the end locations are re-located in hig density points of start locations.

## Summary:
- The mayority of consumers are men.
- The checkout time is less than 20 minutes, which is good in terms of availability of bikes.
- The favorite day for bikesharing is Thursday and favorite times from 5 to 6pm, it is important to create strategies so that there are more hours with high consumption, at least one in the morning target towards people that go to work.
- The Suscription creates loyalty to users, therefore the highst amount of rides come from suscription users. It is important to create strategies and promotions to convert consumers to suscription users
- For further analysis, we can create a map of starting point of Stations with the start locations for users, so that we can if the start locations are spots where the stations are, this can help us to verify that if this are high points, we can guarantee the availability of bikes near the stations
![Start_Station](https://github.com/kplazascp/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Start%20Station.PNG)
- Also, we can evidence that the end stations are very similar to start locations (both order descending so that we can see the most populars), this means most bikes will end in high consumption areas, although it is important to examine the low density points of ending station with high density points of starting station.
